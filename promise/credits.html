        <h1 class="title">In every world, in every moment, in every breath we took...</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
            It wasn't just chance that brought <span class="highlight">you</span> and <span class="highlight">me</span> together—it was destiny, it was a <span class="emphasis">choice.</span> <br> Yours. Mine. Ours.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            When I first met <span class="highlight">you</span>, I thought I knew what love was. But nothing prepared <span class="highlight">me</span> for what <span class="highlight">you</span> would make me feel. <br> How could I have known that a single look, a simple conversation, would lead to this? <br> How could I have known that the moments we shared, no matter how small, would become the threads that bound my heart to yours?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            I remember the first time <span class="highlight">you</span> smiled at <span class="highlight">me</span>, like the world had paused just for us. <br> I remember the feeling of your hand in mine—so familiar, like we were meant to walk this road together, no matter where it led. <br> But more than anything, I remember the quiet moments—the ones when we spoke without words. The late-night talks, the times when nothing needed to be said, just the sound of your voice, the feeling of your presence.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            But then, there were the hard moments. The ones that tested us. The moments when distance seemed unbearable, and I found myself questioning everything. The silence between us that stretched for what felt like an eternity. The moments when we drifted apart, when the world seemed like it was conspiring against us. And yet, through it all, <span class="highlight">you</span> <span class="emphasis">chose</span> to stay. <span class="highlight">You</span> chose to reach out. <span class="highlight">You</span> chose us. <span class="highlight">You</span> chose <span class="emphasis">me.</span>
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            When the storm hit, when my heart broke into a thousand pieces, when anger and pain took over me—I wanted to walk away. I wanted to let go, to let the silence swallow everything. But <span class="highlight">you</span>? <span class="highlight">You</span> didn't let go. Even when I pulled away, even when I shut down, <span class="highlight">you</span> reached for <span class="highlight">me</span>. <span class="highlight">You</span> fought. Not with words or promises, but with <span class="emphasis">love.</span> A love that didn't ask for perfection, a love that just kept <span class="emphasis">being there.</span> And it was that love—your quiet, unwavering love—that pulled me back from the edge.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            So, today, I <span class="highlight">promise</span> <span class="highlight">you</span> this:
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            In every moment, no matter how far we are, I will reach for <span class="highlight">you</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When the world tries to tear us apart, I will hold on tighter.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When silence tries to settle between us, I will speak louder with my actions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I will be your shelter in the storms, your calm in the chaos, your anchor in the waves.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            When the distance feels too much, I will bridge it with every word, every touch, every breath.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            And when we face obstacles that seem insurmountable, I will walk through them with you, hand in hand, side by side, always.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I promise to be the person who chooses <span class="highlight">you</span>, not just once, but again and again.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            In every reality, in every version of us, I will be the one to hold on, to stay, to love you with all that I am.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I will remember the moments we’ve shared—the ones that made us laugh, the ones that made us cry, the ones that built this foundation of love between us.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I will cherish every memory, every second, and never take for granted the beauty of having <span class="highlight">you</span> in my life.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            So, my love, as we walk this path together—through all the universes, through every choice, through every timeline—I choose <span class="highlight">you</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Always. And no matter where life takes us, no matter the distance between us, I will always choose to love <span class="highlight">you</span>, more deeply, more fiercely, more completely than the day before.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I promise that my heart will always be your home, your safe place, your one constant in a world full of uncertainties.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            And when the stars fade, when everything seems lost, know that I will be right here. Right here, by your side, loving <span class="highlight">you</span> in every universe.
        </p>
        

        <p class="paragraph">
            <span class="highlight"> <b>HAPPY PROMISE DAY BABY ❤️</b> </span>
